Granular materials show multiphase behaviour by showing solid-like and fluid-like properties simultaneously. This makes the modelling of such yieldable/flowable materials is difficult.

DEM is a micro-scale method can capture this behaviour, but macro-scale properties are many times of interest.
**Q:** Can it be analogous to stat mech and thermodynamics, where macro scale properties is lower dimensional representation of underlying micro-scale behaviour?

This creation of patterns could be used to explain the acoustic patterns observed when a plate vibrating with certain frequency creates interesting patterns from the displaced grains places on the plate. Nevermind, they've already done it and validated against experiments 🫤.

DOI: 10.1103/PhysRevE.75.051303

- clustering behavior is observed when the system is vibrated with sinusoidal oscillations  
- for the non-sinusoidal signal of type,  
$$A_1 sin(wt) + A_2 sin(2wt+phi)$$
the attraction between intruders decreases, and clustering breaks for phi in the range of 120 to 150 degrees  
- changing the vibration method during the simulation also have the same result, i.e., broken clustering  
- Neutral Buoyancy:  
- does not mean that intruder and host particles have the same density  
- for this system, neutral buoyancy is found when intruder density is 3/4th of host particle density  
- how does one precompute the neutral buoyancy requirements?  
-> the density is adjusted so that intruders remain at mid-bed height on average when the system is vibrated  
- attraction of intruders in sinusoidal vibrations in 2d has been observed already  
- what is the relationship between intruder size and density and host particle size and density that decides if intruders will float or sink in the medium or be neutrally buoyant? aka a regime mapping  
This assumes they are vibrated by the same frequency and amplitude as the sinusoidal signal.  
How to do this?  
-> this can be done via a series of simulations by changing the system's parameters.  
Then in the results, one can track the mean height of the intruder and the standard deviation of positions of intruders vertically over time. potential graphs can look like images attached to the note  

- Is there literature available on mapping?  
-> shishodia2001buoyant has studied the effect of relative density on the equilibrium bed height, i.e., whether the intruder will float or sink  
- why shall I study this effect?  
-> 1. to eliminate the buoyant force component from the observed resistive force on the intruder  
2. to check if the attractive or repulsive nature of vibration can change when particles are not neutrally buoyant. Does the relationship and mechanism of attractive and repulsive force change with a change in buoyancy?

DOI: 10.1007/s10035-019-0973-8

**Abstract**
- The drag acting on an intruder in a three-dimensional frictionless dry granular environment is numerically studied.
- It is found the followings:
	1. There is no yield force for the motion of the intruder without the gravity.
	2. The drag is proportional to the cross section of the moving intruder.
	3. If the intruder is larger than surrounding grains, the drag is proportional to the moving speed V of the intruder for dense systems, but it exhibits a crossover from quadratic to linear dependences of the moving speed when the volume fraction of the surrounding grains is much lower than the jamming point.
	4. There is a plateau regime where the drag is almost independent of V if the size of the intruder is identical to those of the environmental grains and the volume fraction is near the jamming point.

**Problem**

**Method**
- MD Simulation, 3D frictionless environment

**Conclusion**

- Drag proportional to intruder cross section
- Drag proportional to intruder velocity (for dense system)
- Quadratic to linear dependence for low volume fractions
- Platue region near jamming point and intruder size ~ grain size
- Drag expressions for different relative size,volume fraction and Velocity in simulation

	*What happens to the stagnant zones in the presence of multiple intruders?*
- Approach: Simulation + 2 Experimental setups
- The work done by the two rods over the penetration depth was maximum at three-particle diameters. This is invariant to other parameters like frictional force and the size of intruders. The amount of work done was affected by the parameters mentioned above.
- The work done plateaued at large intruder separations and is around 25% more at the maximum than the work done at larger separations ().
- Increasing the intruder's size slightly increases this separation distance of maximum work done.

# 2001. Particle Segregation in Vibrofluidized Beds Due to Buoyant Forces. _Physical Review Letters_ {#sec-shishodia2001ParticleSegregationa}

tags: #literature

Link: 
DOI: 10.1103/PhysRevLett.87.084302

VFBs are commonly used in industries for various thermal processing operations such as drying, heating, cooling, and agglomerating. The vibrofluidized bed is one of the most successful modifications of the conventional fluidized bed and is especially suited for processing sticky granular materials which cannot be fluidized conventionally.

Previous work by Ohtsuki et al. [^1][^2] found that, when an impurity is introduced into a VFB, the impurity moves to a particular equilibrium position depending on the impurity diameter, density, and the bed vibration characteristics. They reported that the equilibrium position could not be predicted using a force balance consisting of the granular pressure force acting on the impurity and the impurity weight. [^2]

## Investigated
- Influence of size, density, and excitation parameters on an impurity’s equilibrium position within a VFB.
- We propose and verify a model whereby the impurity position is, in fact, predicted by a balance between the net granular pressure, or “buoyant,” force within the VFB and the impurity weight.

## Simulation setup
- Only those simulations in which all of the collisions have a duration equal to that of a two-particle impact are considered completely fluidized.
### Particle properties
- 2D soft particle DEM Model
- Host particles: 300 frictionless, inelastic disks of diameter $d$ and density $\rho$
- Intruder: diameter $d_I$ and density $\rho_I$
- 0.95 COR for particle-particle and wall-particle
### Simulation Domain
- Box width: $20d$
- Periodic boundaries to avoid side-wall effects (e.g. convection)
### Vibration parameters
- amplitude $a$
- angular frequency $\omega$
- dimensionless acceleration $\Gamma = a\omega^2/g$

## Analytical Section
- Pressure is non-dimensionalised by $\rho g d$ as follows
  $$P^\prime = \frac{P}{\rho g d}$$
- Vibration frequency is non-dimensionalised by $\sqrt{g/d}$ as follows
  $$\omega^\prime = \omega \sqrt{d/g}$$
- Stress calculation is done by binning the simulation domain into chunks in one direction
- Streaming Normal Stress is given by
	$$\tau_{S,ii} = \rho \phi <v_i^\prime>$$
where,
$\rho$ is particle mass density
$\phi$ is solid volume fraction in a bin or simulation domain
$<v_i^\prime>$ is time-averaged fluctuating velocity in $i$th direction
- Collisional Component of Normal Stress is given by
  

## Results
### Effect of collision frequency
- If the collision frequency is large the impurity will not fluctuate much about its equilibrium position since the restoring pressure force working against the impurity weight will be nearly continuous.
- If the collision frequency is small, however; the impurity position will fluctuate considerably since the restoring force for the particle weight will occur in discrete impacts rather than as a continuous pressure.

### Equilibrium height as function of density ratio
- Equilibrium height decreases as the density ratio increases.
- Density ratio range is as follows
	  $$5 < d_{intr}/d < 8$$
![Equilibrium Height as Function of Density Ratio](assets/shishodia2001.png)

### Modes of Momentum Transfer
- The “streaming” or “kinetic” mode is the transport of momentum as a particle moves through the material carrying its momentum with it.
- The “collisional” mode is the transport of momentum by interparticle collisions.
- The streaming mode dominates at low densities where collisions are infrequent and the collisional mode is dominant at high densities as the particles cannot move far between collisions.

$$F_p = \frac{dp}{dy}d_{intr}^2$$
$$\frac{dp}{dy} = -\frac{M_{intr}g}{d_{intr}^2} = - \frac{\pi}{4}\rho_{intr}g$$

>This is coming from taylor series expansion and is approximated to single term. Hence the unstable equilibrium location could be coming in the results.
> ~ Prof. Manaswita Bose

- Granular materials are common in daily life and in many industrial processes.
- Both fundamental research and industrial application studies are crucial for understanding the transport properties and segregation mechanisms of vibrating granular beds.
- One major related research topic is granular materials subjected to external vibration;
- Such granular materials exhibit complex movement and Brazil nut segregation.
- Understanding the transport properties and the rising of an intruder immersed in granular materials is a challenge in granular flow research.
- In particular, granular segregation is a complex and poorly understood process.

Abstract
- Sonine polynomial approximation for the mass transport of intruder in the gas
- dependence of ratio of granular temperature of intruder and gas on the solid volume fraction
- A transition boundary between the BNE and RBNE based on the thermal diffusion factor (introduced in previous work)
- Used Gaussian noise for driving the gas

Problem

Method
- Developed theoretical model for the mass diffusion of both species
- used DSMC simulations to validate the theoretical results

Conclusion

- Resemblance to our methodology
	- Diffusive driving with Gaussian noise added to the velocities
- Difference from our methodology
	- Post collision velocities are assigned only to the intruder and not to the particle
	- time step is defined in terms of collision frequency 

- Some questions I need answers of
	- $\phi = 0$: what does this mean in context of this paper?
	- what is $\Lambda$ & transition for RBNE and BNE
	- 50-50% intruder & particle ratio
	- highlight the main objectives of paper

- Regimes of intruder dynamics
	- proportional to
		- drag force
		- intruder velocity
		- flow inertial number
	- as follows
		- fluctuation dominated regime for small drag forces
		- viscous regime for intermediate drag force (linear force-velocity relation)
		- inertial (cavity formation) regime for large drag forces (quadratic force velocity relation)
- map against intrusion studies done for
	- static bed
	- vibrated bed
	- diffusive medium
	- medium + fluid
	- flowing bed

> Transition from viscous regime to inertial regime depends on inertial number

> Quantitative similarity between intruder drag in shear flows and Stokesian drag on sphere in viscous fluid for intruder Reynolds number spanning 5 orders of magnitude.

> Proposed a modified Stokes drag model that accounts for secondary dependence of drag coefficient on the inertial number and intruder size and density ratios.

> When the drag model is coupled with a segregation force model for intruders in dense granular flows, it is possible to predict the velocity of gravity-driven segregation of an intruder particle in shear flow simulations.

Link: https://www.cambridge.org/core/product/identifier/S0022112019010358/type/journal_article
DOI: 10.1017/jfm.2019.1035

**Context/background**
- Zuriguel et al. and Pascheco and Ruiz Suarez demonstrated long-ranged force between intruders placed in certain distance from each other.
- papers aims a unified explanation of attractive and repulsive forces between 2 intruders
- proposed mechanism: building up of force chains and their subsequent buckling
*if there is attraction and repulsion in the same system, can you make them oscillate somehow? is that possible by any arrangement?*
- speculatively, some speculate this to be the origin of the segregation phenomena in granular materials

**Method**
- Done simulation study using Discrete Element Method
- System content: 2 intruders in a 3D granular bed
- Diameter of grains (d) with polydispersity of 10%
- Intruder diameter: 5d
- Centre to centre distance between intruders (L) is varied
- Timestep: $10^{-4} \sqrt{\frac{d}{g}}$
- Friction coefficient ($\mu$): 0.5 (unless stated otherwise)
- No relative velocity between intruders: L is constant during simulation

**Simulation details**
- Force model by Brilliantov et al., Silbert et al.
$$F^{ij}_n = \sqrt{R_{eff}\delta} (K_n \delta n_{ij} - m_{eff}\gamma_n v^{ij}_n)$$
$$F^{ij}_t = \sqrt{R_{eff}\delta} (K_t \Delta s_t + m_{eff}\gamma_t v^{ij}_t)$$
Where $$\delta = \frac{(d_i + d_j)}{2} - |r_i - r_j|,\ \ n_{ij} = \frac{(r_i - r_j)}{|r_i - r_j|}$$
$\Delta s_t$ is tangential displacement vector \\
Grains make contact if $\delta \geq 0$ \\
$K$ is nonlinear spring constant (in scale of $\rho d g$ ) \\
$\gamma$ damping coefficients (in scale of $\sqrt{\frac{g}{d^3}}$ \\
Effective radius and effective mass are given as
$$R_{eff} = \frac{d_1d_2}{2(d_1+d_2)},\ \ m_{eff} = \frac{m_1m_2}{m_1+m_2}$$
- Consider slip contact if $F_t > \mu F_n$ and $\mu$ = 0.5 unless mentioned otherwise
- Time step (dt) : $10^{-4}\sqrt{d/g}$
- Forces on intruders recorede every 5dt
- Average is computed once the system reached mean steady state
- Energy is zero in system before starting simulations
- No relative velocity between intruders. i.e. $L$ is constant throughout the simulation
- Grain relative components are given as follows
$$v^{ij}_n = \left(\left[ \dot{r_i} - \dot{r_j} + \omega_i \times \frac{d_i n_{ij}}{2} - \omega_j\times \frac{d_j n_{ij}}{2} \right] \cdot n_{ij} \right)n_{ij}$$ 
$$ v^{ij}_t = \left[ \dot{r_i} - \dot{r_j} + \omega_i \times \frac{d_in_{ij}}{2} - \omega_j \times \frac{d_jn_{ij}}{2} \right] - v^{ij}_n$$

**Results**
- Mean drag force ($F_D$) and sideways force ($F_S$) calculated by averaging their instantaneous values after a mean steady-state behavior.
- Stress tensor ($\sigma_R(t)$) and pressure ($P_R(t)$) calculated in any region $R$ using $$\sigma_R(t)= \frac{1}{V_R}\sum_{i\neq j}^{\rm{Region}\ R} (F^{ij} \otimes r_{ij})\ \ ,\ \ P_R(t) = - \frac{1}{3} \rm{Tr}(\sigma_R(t))$$
- This is a scheme by [Guillard, Fortere, Pouliquen 2014] , Drescher \& Josselin de Jong 1972 , Seguin et al. 2016
- $V_R$ is volume of the region
- Pressure head ($P_{\rm{head}}$) acting on intruders is defined as pressure in region $z =\pm d$ before we initiate motion of intruders. i.e. $$P_{\rm{head}}= \frac{P_{z=\pm d}(t=0)}{\rho d g}$$
- $P_{\rm{head}}$ can be varied by changing pressure exerted by the top wall $P_W$

**Results for drag force**
- Asymmetry in sideways force is induced by second intruder and not because of the wall.
- At low (L-D): repulsion
- At large (L-D): attraction going through a maxima
- Very low variation in drag with changing (L-D)
- Is lower for 2 intruder case compared to single intruder
- Increase linearly with Pressure and friction
- **Origin of granular drag**
	- drag originated by co-existing creation and failure of force chains
	- intruders moving alongside buckle the chains and reduce the drag	

**Results for sideways force**
- Magnitude of maximum attraction point depends linearly on $P_{\mathrm{head}}$
- At constant $V$ and $\mu$, point of maximum attraction and point of zero sideways force is same for varying $P_{\mathrm{head}}$
- Force chains use surfaces of other intruder when intrudes are close and stabilize themselves. When L-D increase, stabilization decrease as force chains are in shear zone of the other intruder. As L-D increase further, they start regaining the stability but surface is distant enough to not allow build up of enough pressure.. resulting in decreasing attraction after the maxima

QUESTION: Is this caused by excluded volume effect? how do we confirm which mechanism is behind this?

Lorenzo Conti. 2020. Novel rotational effects of granular intruders in dense granular systems. (Doctoral dissertation, University of Edinburgh)

Link: https://ethos.bl.uk/OrderDetails.do?uin=uk.bl.ethos.806201
DOI: 

**Some excerpts from the thesis**
> Possibly the most interesting result regarding granular segregation in connection to the present study is the work of Jing et al. (2017) who found that setting the inter-particle friction coefficient to zero, no segregation is observed in polydisperse granular assemblies - while such work doesn’t directly analyse the rotation of the granular particles, the authors conjecture that the absence of segregation at zero friction is due to the absence of particle rotation and stipulate that particle rotation is essential for segregation to occur. Such hypothesis, however, appears to be in contrast with the results of Ding et al. (2011) where all experiments are carried out with theoretically infinite rolling resistance (no rotational degree of freedom) and a lift/upward movement is still observed, thus suggesting that there are additional friction-induced mechanisms to particles rotation causing segregation in binary mixtures. 

> All data here presented employs Hookean contacts, although several of the simulations here presented were repeated with Hertzian contacts, these returned similar results, hence indicating that the phenomenons here presented are independent of the [[Notes on Particle Contact Models]] used, as found in many other granular studies (e.g. Wang 2017).

> In Chapter 6 we look at the flow of particles against a rotating intruder, with gravity being no longer present, hence a characteristic unit of gravity cannot be used in this case. In such flow-based scenarios it is customary to adopt a scaling based on the driving measure of flow (e.g. shear rate in a shear-based flow scenario): however, in this case such scaling is not an option because, as will be seen in Section 6.4, the dependent variables do not scale linearly with the imposed particles’ flow velocity upstream of the intruder.

> These drag forces, coupled with the fact that finding ways to generate translative motion in the first place is still an open challenge (Section 2.4), means that methods for locomotion or propulsion at fully-buried depths, other than very close to the surface (Maladen et al., 2011b), are yet to be found.

> Scope for future research includes, most importantly, the need to expand the present study to understand how particles’ shape affects the motion of a rotating intruder, although this has been partly done by testing a simple device with rotating parts in grain barley and wheat in Section 5.5. For this, the computational cost both in terms of time and resources for simulating particles other than spherical and the lack of an established way to quantify particle shape diversion from spherical remains a challenge. Work to simulate the behaviour within cereal grains, coupled with the rigid body dynamics of a more complete working intruder design is currently being carried out by the writer together with colleagues - this is intended to also study the effect of more complex intruder shapes.

> An extension of the present study would be a study of microscopic parameters such as fabric tensor and coordination number in order to try to identify the source of the phenomenon outlined in Section 4.3.

- Investigated the intrusion of an object in a granular media
- Reporting of a general model for plastic flow (as a quasistatic process)
- The drag force on the intruder is considered as a combination of hydrostatic-like force and viscous force
- For submerged intruders moving at slow velocities, the drag force acting on the intruder is proportional to penetration depth. This observation is confirmed by theories like Resistive Force Theory (RFT) and Local Friction Force Model (LFFM)
- **The key assumption of RFT and LFFM**: Friction tangential to intruder surface contributes negligibly to the resistive force.
	*Can this friction contribute to the resistive force in case of multiple intruders?*
- In gist: $F_d \sim$ Area of the cross-section of the intruder, depth of penetration (have a pressure-like term that contains packing density and g as well). The proportionality constant is associated with internal friction coefficient mu
- The proportionality constant depends on the nature of granular material and not on the intruder’s properties.
- They later show that when appropriately scaled, the force acting on the intruder can be treated like Archimedes’ law, with the proportionality constant being K
- At the initial depth of penetration, there is non-linear relation between force and depth as this is the stage of formation of the stagnant zone in front of the intruder. The force-depth relationship becomes linear after forming the stagnant zone in front of the intruder.

- Strategy used to model non-uniform temperature i.e. spatially varying temperature:
	- Problem is mapped into one with uniform temperature and space-dependent field
	- This means that field plays an important role in granular temperature
- Density profile of particles is also in-homogeneous. Lower densities show ideal gas behaviour

- Done simulation of magnus effect on circular, rotating, translating intruder in a 2d granular material
- magnus effect was observed for range of area fraction: [0.35, 0.82] (Area fraction: similar to volume fraction but for 2d)
- At high speeds, lift to drag ratio saturates
	*What does the saturation of lift to drag ratio mean exactly?*
- rotational speed would affect the asymmetry of distribution of number of contacts and direction of tangential velocities
	*can it impact the shear experienced each of the force chains and make uneven?*
	*how would area fraction and relative particle size would affect this?*
- Magnus effect in granular media is related to
	- switching in direction of tangential forces during the collision with object
	- Asymmetric shear on force chains because of larger size of medium particles than viscous fluids
	- compared to the viscous fluids, the number of contacts are also distributed unevenly across the surface (perimeter in this case) of the intruder object
- Phenomena common in granular media and viscous fluids
	- Instabilities
		- Kelvin-Helmholtz
		- Rayleigh-Plateau
		- Rayleigh-Taylor
	- Capillary action
	- Lift and drag on obstacles
- Phenomena unique to granular media (not observed in viscous fluids)
	- Jamming: can be prevented using helical inner wall texture in vertical pipe flow
	
- Why Magnus effect works?
	1. Explanation for frictionless fluids
		- The rotating object interacts with the fluid and have different fluid velocities at the different sides of the objects. This creates a pressure difference because of Bernoulli's principle. The generation of lift by object's interaction with the fluid has one important assumption.
		- There is no friction between interacting fluid particles and the object surface.
		- Hence, this explanation is only valid for frictionless fluids.
	2. Explanation for frictional fluids
		- Swanson[12] used Boundary Layer Theory to show circulation around the cylinder produced by difference in velocities of upper and lower layer.

- Inverse Magnus Effect
	- Observed for specific values of $\mathrm{Re}$ because one boundary layer was turbulent while other remained laminar
	- Observed for free molecular flow (on Knudsen scale probably) but vanishes once system density crosses a critical value

- Magnus effect in granular media
	- Lift generation mechanism
		- Asymmetry from gravity or intruder shape
		- Difference of shear rate across intruder
	- Use symmetric intruder with no rotation to eliminate lift
	- Wiggle the intruder to create lift on the intruder

DOI: 10.1103/PhysRevLett.107.048002

## Introduction

- Observed liquid-gas phase separation experimentally in vertical vibration between 2 horizontal plates.
- Also modelled the same system using Molecular Dynamics simulation
- Phase transition phenomena have been observed in granular system when subjected to vibration
- Driven granular gas: a good to understand steady state systems far from equilibrium
- In literature, solid-liquid co-existence have also been observed in similar geometries


## Setup
- Vertically vibrated cell confining glass spheres(Polydisperse spherical particles. Mean diameter: 610 um) (not a 2D vibrated bed)
- The cell is a trap made of two plates: lower being aluminium and upper one as a glass plate
- Both plates separated by a square aluminium frame (inner side 13 cm) with can vary the gap between plates
- Vibration given by an electromagnetic shaker with signal from frequency generator
- Vertical motion monitored by accelerometer


## Measurement values
| Parameter | Value |
|--|--|
| Gap between plates | 0.5,0.75,1.0 cm |
| Vibration signal frequency | 23-65 Hz |
| Dimensionless acceleration | 1-18 |


## Results
- Phases separate as amplitude increases
- Pattern stay stationary for a given amplitude
- The phases again become homogeneous as amplitude increase further
- No crystalline order observed in High density phase of material
- Phase separation amplitude was independent of vibration frequency (in investigated range)
- The phase separation is function of:
    1. Vibration amplitude 
    2. Volume fraction
- Phase separation does not occur when system is under random forcing.
- Observable even in low air pressures ($O(10^{-2})$) Torrs (Normal atmospheric pressure is 760 Torr!)


## Replication via MD simulation
| Parameters | Values|
|--|--|
| Particle model | Hard sphere  |
| Particle diameter | $d$ (polydispersity of std-dev being $0.06 d$ |
| Plate gap | $16d$ |
| Square side | $210d$ |
| Interparticle collisions | inelastic with $\alpha = 0.9$ (velocity independent) |
| Particle-plate collisions | elastic |
| Horizontal Walls | periodic |

## Simulation results
- Phase separation detected using time-averaged local densities
- Results qualitatively similar to experimental results
- Qualitative differences likely caused by neglected dissipation mechanisms
- The interface between phases remain circular: indicating effective surface tension
- Short range order is observed in dense phase via pair correlation(Radial probability distribution of finding the particle) (Similar to classical liquids and gases)


## Proposed Mechanism based on Simulations
- Phase separation driven by spinodal decomposition(Spontaneous phase separation of 2 thermodynamic phases without nucleation)
- Mechanism is different from separation mechanisms like:
    1. Clustering by inelastic collisions
    2. Cohesive interaction between grains
- In dense region, the thermal energy is dissipate away at faster rate due to high number of dissipative collisions.
- In dilute medium, significant number of particle propagate without collisions and hence get synchronized further maintaining the high energy, low density state

- For a bi-disperse system, they found that there is an attractive force between large particles when the distance between them is smaller than diameter of small particles.
- Small particles are excluded from the gap formed between large particles leading to no pressure in the space between large particle. On the other hand, there is pressure exerted at the outer side of larger particles. This combination leads to overall pressure exerted on the larger particles causing them to move closer to each other.

> Equipartition of energy does not apply in a vibrated granular mixture of the same size but different mass, and the mass difference has a stronger effect on non-equipartition of energy than the difference in the coefficients of restitution of particles.[^1][^2]

> Segregation in binary mixtures has been observed in horizontally shaken granular layers, and it has been observed that the onset of segregation has the features of a continuous phase transition. It has been speculated that one of the reasons for segregation could be the attractive force due to the excluded-volume interaction between large particles in a background of agitated small particles. [^3]

> The magnitude of the attractive force is determined from the pair distribution function for the particles, and not on the basis of the macroscopic segregation phenomenon. A theory, similar to that for the entropic aggregation in colloidal suspensions, is developed for this phenomenon.

- Observed in regime where diffusion is larger compared to convection. There is no large scale convective motion in the vibrating bed.
- Effect is not observed when bed frequency [^4] is below critical frequency where convective motion is found [^5].


## Exclusion of volume between colloidal particles in polymer solution

![Excluded Volume Effect](assets/excluded-volume.png)

> Exclusion of the polymer molecule from the region between the particles when the distance between the particles is less than the radius of gyration of the molecule. This force is usually referred to as the “**entropic attraction**” force due to the increase in the volume available to the polymers when the distance between the colloidal particles is less than the radius of gyration of the polymers. [^6]

Exclusion surface has a radius of $R + R_G$, where $R_G$ is radius of gyration of polymer. When the excluded surfaces overlap, the polymer is excluded from the region between the particles. This means that in the excluded volume region, there is no osmotic pressure due to polymers. But outer surface experiences osmotic pressure and hence there is a net attractive force on the colloidal particles. The attractive force is proportional to osmotic pressure times cross-sectional area of surface $S$ from which polymers are excluded.

## Mapping entropic attraction to excluded volume interaction in vibrofluidized beds
We have,
- Osmotic pressure due to polymers -> pressure due to fluctuating velocity of smaller particles
- Pressure profile in vibrofluidized bed is not constant and hence more complicated calculation is involved in it.
- 2 aspects of the calculation process
	1. Calculation of potential due to excluded volume effect
	2. Calculation of increase in pair distribution function due to potential
- The attractive potential between the large particles is inferred from the pair distribution function for a pair of particles, which is defined such that $g(r)dr$ is the probability of finding a second particle in the differential volume $dr$ about the position $r$ from the center of the first particle [^7].
$$g(r) = \exp(-U(r)/T)$$

> The pressure due to the small particles is a product of the temperature and a monotonically increasing function of density. Due to this decreasing pressure gradient, the large particle equilibrates at a position where the difference in the force exerted on the top and bottom surfaces is equal to the weight of the particle.

# 2021. Accurate buoyancy and drag force models to predict particle segregation in vibrofluidized beds {#sec-kianioshtorjani2021accuratebuoyancy}

DOI: 10.1103/PhysRevE.103.062903

The segregation of large intruders in an agitated granular system is of high practical relevance, yet the accurate modelling of the segregation (lift) force is challenging as a general formulation of a granular equivalent of a buoyancy force remains elusive.

Strong evidence for the validity of the generalization of the Archimedean formulation of the buoyancy force which only requires an expression for the solid fraction of the intruder, hence allowing for a computationally less demanding calculation of the buoyancy force as coarse-graining is avoided.

Dependence of the lift force on the density of the bed particles and the intruder diameter, and the independence of the lift force on the the intruder diameter, and the independence of the lift force on the intruder density and the vibration strength (once a critical value is exceeded).

- Characterization of phenomena and transitions via dimensionless parameters and phase diagram via experiments.

## Experimental Setup
- Quasi 2D setup
- Materials used:
	- Perspex for container
	- Glass beads as granular material
- System dimensions: $L\times D\times H = 101\times 5\times 150~\mathrm{mm}$
- Diameter of glass beads: $1~\mathrm{mm}$
- Density of glass beads: $2600~\mathrm{kg.m^{-3}}$
- Coefficient of restitution: $0.95$

## Natural Control Parameters
1. Shaking parameter: $a^2\omega^2/gl$ 
	- Ratio of kinetic energy inserted in the system by the shaking bottom to the potential energy associated with typical displacement of particles
2. Number of bead layers
3. Inelasticity parameter: $\epsilon = (1-e^2)$
4. Aspect ratio: $L/h_0$
- Shaking parameter and Number of bead layers will be the focus of the study for regime mapping

## A Note On Shaking Parameter
- **Mild Fluidization**: The granular bed follows the motion of the bottom vibrating wall. Hence the characteristic length for displacement is the shaking amplitude $a$. The energy ratio hence becomes the shaking acceleration as follows
	  $$\Gamma = \frac{a\omega^2}{g}$$
- **Strong Fluidization**: Granular bed does not follow the motion of the bottom vibrating wall. Hence an intrinsic displacement length scale is taken to be particle diameter $d$. The resulting expression is termed as Dimensionless shaking strength given by
		$$S = \frac{a^2\omega^2}{gd}$$
- **Intermediate Fluidization**: There is a competition of length scales in this regime. Hence, transitions are influenced by changing one of the length scales. Hence choice of the length scale is not *a priori* clear.

# 1983. Characterisation of Strange Attractors {#sec-grassberger1983CharacterizationStrange}


## Background
- Dissipative dynamical systems often exhibit "strange" attractors in phase space
- Characterisation of strange attractors is done by fractal dimension D < degrees of freedom F
- Measure of strangeness = Fractal (Hausdorff) Dimension
- Problem: Difficult to compute D when D > 2
- Using a single time series to extract the measure of strangeness is found impractical for systems with D > 2
- 

## Research Question and Key Findings
- Measure of strangeness using time series that doesn't need to rely on Poincare Maps (Related to fractal dimensions)


## Methodology and Data

N-point long time series denoted as

$$X_i = X(t + i\tau)$$

Correlation integral is given as

$$C(r) = \lim_{N \rightarrow \infty} \frac{1}{N^2} \sum_{i,j = 1}^N \theta(r - |X_i - X_j|)$$
Where $\theta$ is Heaviside function.

Core thesis of the paper:

$$C(r) \propto r^\nu$$

> Drag force on intruder  expressed in terms of dimensionless drag coefficient
$$C_d = \frac{F_d}{\left[ \frac{1}{2} \rho \nu U^2 (D + d) \right]} $$

> Not much variation between steady and unsteady drag coefficient

> The drag coefficient is larger than its nominal value during an initial transient stage, during which a shock wave develops in front of the cylinder. Once the shock has developed, the drag coefficient remains constant despite the stream’s acceleration.
### Literature Findings

> Unsteady flow around immersed objects is also observed in the segregation of impurities due to forced vibrations. (per https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s100350100093)

## Implications and Future Research
- In vibrated granular bed, the shock propagation might not be symmetric and hence the information might travel at different rates in the vibrated granular bed.
	- This is because in vibrated granular bed, there is a density gradient of the particles established in the medium.
